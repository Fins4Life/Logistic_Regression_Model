Task 1b: Build a logistic regression model 
Using the dataset “student_data.csv,” write code to (1) create a visualization of the data, (2) fit a model using logistic regression, (3) output model coefficients and performance metrics such as accuracy and AUC and ROC; NOTE: For this exercise, you will train and test on the same given dataset, instead of doing train/test split.
